## Development
To start with, I had the code from [the command line version of the quiz](https://github.com/WhileTrueDoNothing/programming-formative-quiz). This contained classes for questions, along with functions for generating questions from a given CSV file and running a quiz.

However, most of these were designed for the command line, and needed to be broken down into smaller functions. 

[insert some stuff here about breaking down functions and adding the user class once I do that]
